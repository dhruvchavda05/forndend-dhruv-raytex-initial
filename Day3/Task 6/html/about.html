    <p style="font-size: larger;"><b>1. Establish a mission statement.</b><br><br>
        Your About page can and will be more comprehensive than a single mission statement, but to draw people in, you need to succinctly state your goal in the industry upfront. What is your business here to do? Why should your website visitors care? This information will give the reader something to remember about your company long after they leave your website.<br><br><br><br>
        
       <b> 2. Outline your company story.</b><br><br>
    Every business has a story to tell. Even if you're running a start-up, you might not have a long history of changes and growth (yet), but it's a nice touch to talk about how you got to where you are on the About page. So, isolate the milestones before your company's founding, and use them to give readers some backstory on your current venture.<br><br><br><br>
        
        <b>3. Reveal how you've evolved.</b><br><br>
    There's no shame in admitting how your business strategy — or even your way of thinking — has changed since you began. In fact, these evolutions can improve the story you tell to website visitors.<br><br><br><br>
        
        About pages are perfect spaces to talk about where you started, how you've grown, and the ideals that have helped your organization mature. Use these moments to further your company story and show people that you're always ready to change and adapt to the needs of your industry.<br><br><br><br>
        
       <b> 4. State your "aha!" moment.</b><br><br>
        Every good company was founded on an idea — something the current marketplace might not yet offer. What was your idea? Use this "Aha!" moment as a pivot point when telling your company story. What was a challenge you faced while developing your company? How did this challenge or discovery shape what you are today?</p>
